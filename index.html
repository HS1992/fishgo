          <h4> OIL SPILLS</h4>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
             <p>An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, & is a form of pollution</p>
              <p>The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land.</p>
              <p>Oil is an ancient fossil fuel that we can use to heat our homes, generate electricity & power large sectors of our economy. But when oil accidentally spills into the ocean, it can cause a big problem. </p>
              <p>Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat</p>
              <p>On April 20, 2010  the largest accidental oil spill had been recorded in the history of Gulf of Mexico, after a surge of natural gas blasted through a cement well cap that had recently been installed to seal a well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon oil platform.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare…</p>
           <p>Coral reefs are important ocean habitats and offers a compelling case of the risks of climate change. Reefs provide a large fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. They have been called “ the rain forests of the seas.”</p>
           <p>Some researchers and scientists have estimated that about 25% of all marine species live in &around coral reefs, making them one of the most important diverse habitats in the world </p> 
           <p>The worst bleaching event had been recorded in the history in Australia. And again in 2017. </p>
           <p>It was estimated that  about half of the coral was killed between the two events. Bleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer than average sea surface temperature. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthell  leaving the skeletal structures with a “ bleached” appearance. As the climate warms, mass bleaching events are lasting longer, becoming more frequent, and are affecting reefs that had never bleached before.</p>
           <p>Between 2014 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef, along with other reefs around the world including in the Caribbean and Hawaii, experienced a global bleaching event that is now considered the longest, most widespread, and the most damaging.</p>

          <h4> INDUSTRIAL WAST</h4>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
            <p> It is extremely hazardous to us & our environment when industrial waste is generated. The amount of liquid industrial waste that is dumped into the water has reached an unacceptably high level, posing a serious threat to marine ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The disposal of trash has significant environmental consequences  & can result in catastrophic problems. Landfills sites, which are  holes in the earth, sometimes specifically built pits, are where  much of the waste is buried in the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p> Some garbage will ultimately decay, but not all of it, and during the process it may emit a foul odour or produce methane gas, whic is explosive & contributes to global warming by warming the atmosphere. </p>
              <p>The leachate created as waste decomposes has the  potential to pollute the environment. Landfills that are not  properly maintained may attract pests & produce litter.</p>
              <p>whene  garbage is incinerated, gases released into the atmosphere an pollute the air & contribute to acid rain, & the ash produced might potentially include heavy metals & other.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic text-warning">Our global climate is changing and human activities, including greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and ozone depletion are at least in part responsible (Würsig et al., 2002).Trying to predict the precise consequences for life on the
                  planet is difficult and this is especially true for highly mobile marine mammal predators. These are inherently difficult to
                  study and adequately long term data sets defining marine
                  predators’ normal biology, ranges and habitats are typically
                  rare. Indeed, we are now at the point when the links between
                  global climatic change and predator responses are ‘only just
                  being explored’ (Forcada et al., 2005). In addition, the effects
                  of Climate Change on higher trophic levels can be difficult to
                  understand because they involve various relationships that
                  may be non-trivial and nonlinear and, possibly, affected by
                  significant time-lags (Lusseau et al., 2004). The constraints of
                  existing climate models also severely limit predictive ability for particular species (IWC, 1996) and, in addition, patterns and trends in species diversity and in the open oceans are enigmatic (Worms et al., 2005).H

                  Here we review what is known of the impacts of Climate Change
on marine predators and in addition consider the effects caused
by ‘normal’ marine circulation fluctuations, including the El Niño/
Southern Oscillation of the Pacific Ocean. Whilst this phenomenon creates an average surface temperature anomaly of
only 1.6o
C, it still has an important negative influence on coastal
upwelling systems that bring nutrients to the surface and fuel
highly productive marine ecosystems and fisheries

                  inhabit. Marine mammal ranges are generally related to species

                  some in the temperate zones and some only at the poles. Whilst
                  quite a few species can move between different temperatures
                  zones during regular migrations, they may be adapted to particular temperature regimes at particular parts of their annual
                  cycles. For example, young animals may require warmer waters
                  for their early growth and development. Marine mammals typically exploit patchy prey species that they require in dense concentrations. Hence their distributions tend to reflect both static
                  features (such as depth and slope) and more mobile ones (such
                  as fronts and upwellings) where productivity is high. </p>

                <p>Burns (2002) emphasised the importance of Antarctica, where
                  90 percent of the world’s great whales feed, and that temperatures in some areas have already risen by 4-5o
                  C in only 50 years.
                  He also noted the importance of the zooplankton species krill
                  (Euphau­siacea) and its relationship to the extent of sea-ice and
                  the algae associated with it which are a critical food resource for
                  krill3
                  . In areas where the sea-ice has receded, salps (tunicates
                  of the species Salpa thompsoni) tend to dominate and may outcompete the krill. Salps are more tolerant of warmer and lower
                  nutrient water than krill and there is evidence that their range
                  is expanding with profound implications for the Southern Ocean
                  food web, including penguins, albatrosses, seals and whales,
                  which despite their wide foraging ranges, are all susceptible to
                  krill shortages (Atkinson et al., 2004). </p>
                  <p>Areas of open water in the polar ice-pack, known as polynyas or

                     and
                    their extent may be affected by Climate Change (Burns, 2002). In
                    the Arctic, no one species of plankton dominates but a diminution
                    of the phytoplankton populations, with knock-on effects throughout the Arctic food chains, is predicted. Burns (2002) suggests</p>

                <p>that several key prey species for cetaceans may be affected but
                  adds “some cetacean species in the region, such as fin whales
                  (Balaeonoptera physalus) and bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) have demonstrated adaptability in feeding behaviour and
                  may be able to switch to other species”. With this statement,
                  he introduces an important theme for further consideration, the
                  issue of the adaptability of marine apex predators.</p>
                  <p>Burns (2002) also noted that global warming may foster poisonous algal blooms and contribute to epizootics and it appears that
                    there has been a significant increase in mass die-offs in marine
                    mammal populations in the last few years (Simmonds and Mayer,
                    1997; Robinson et al., 2005). Whilst, in many cases, viruses (notably of the typically highly pathogenic morbillivirus family) have
                    been identified as the proximate cause, environmental factors
                    may have exacerbated or even predicated these epizootics
                    (Simmonds and Mayer, 1997). For example, in the case of the
                    die-off of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), which spread
                    across the entire Mediterranean in the 1990s resulting in the loss
                    of thousands of animals, the poor nutritional state of the dolphins
                    resulting from low nutrient input to the eastern Mediterranean
                    – caused originally by abnormally low rainfall – may y have been a
                    precipitating feature (Simmonds and Mayer, 1997).</p>
                    <p>In addition to Climate Change, another by-product of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations is the acidification of seawater. It has been suggested that squid – which are key prey
                      species for many deep-diving marine mammal species – may be
                      espe­cially vulnerable to this change. The high energy swimming method of squid and their high metabolism requires a good supply of oxygen from the blood and increasing CO2
                      concentration
                     low­ers blood pH and its capacity to carry oxygen (TRS, 2005).</p>

                      oceans has recently been investigated by Worms et al. (2005)
                      who found what appears to be a general rule: that diversity is
                      positively correlated with thermal fronts, dissolved oxygen and
                      a non-linear function of temperature (with an optimum of about
                      23˚ C). </p>

                <p>Predator demographics can of course be expected to be affected
                  by prey, so changes in prey distribution or abundance may precede shifts or negative outcomes in predator populations. Würsig
                  et al. (2002) stressed the importance of the El Niño events as a
                  proxy for Climate Change (although a change in the incidence of
                  these events could also be a feature of Climate Change itself).
                  They noted that recent events have prompted reproductive failure (especially in the form of high juvenile mortality) in colonies
                  of seabirds and seals. For example, in the major El Niño year of
                  1982, all female Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) lost their pups. Several distributional shifts also occurred
                  in other marine species at this time. For example, near-bottom
                  spawning market squid (Loligo opalescens) left the southern California area, followed by the short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) that normally prey on them. Whether this
                  loss of prey and apparently climate-induced shift caused deaths
                  or health-impairment is not known. A few years later, an influx of
                  Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) into the same region occurred and they fed on the by now returned market squid. Würsig et
                  al. (2002) suggest that the dolphins may be taking advantage of
                  the niche left by the pilot whales. During the same event there
                  was also an expansion of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from southern to central California and they remained there
                  after the El Niño event ended (Würsig et al., 2002). </p>
                  <p>On a large scale, it is predicted that species will shift towards the
                    poles and, ultimately, this is likely to result in a reduced global
                    range for those that are most cold water adapted. </p>

                <p>  Perry et al.
                  (2005) examined long-term, climate-related changes in demer­sal
                  fish in the North Sea.They found that both exploited and non-exploited fish responded markedly to recent increases in sea
                  temperature, with nearly two thirds of species shifting their mean
                  latitude or depth (or both) over a 25 year period. There is some
                  evidence that predators are following suit. MacLeod et al. (2005)
                  considered cetacean strandings and sighting frequency and
                  relative abundance in north-west Scotland. The data sug­gested
                  a range expansion of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis
                  – a warmer water species) and a decrease in range of WhiteBeaked Dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostris). Their data ‘may
                  be the first direct evidence that this [pole-ward shift] is indeed
                  happening in a cetacean species’. Changes in sperm whale
                  (Physeter macrocephalus) distribution in the North East Atlantic, based on strandings data, has recently been related to shifts
                  in the North Atlantic Oscillacion (NAO) which probably affects
                  their squid prey species (Robinson et al., 2005). </p>
                 
                <p>Population level responses apart from distribution shifts are also
                  possible and Lusseau et al. (2004) using two unusually long-term
                  and detailed data sets, found that the group size of bottlenose
                  dolphins in the Moray Firth, Scotland, and orcas (Orcinus orca)
                  in Johnstone Strait, Canada, varied from year to year in rela­tion
                  to large scale ocean climate variation. Local indices of prey
                  abundance also varied with climate and the cetaceans tended
                  to live in smaller groups when there were less salmon around,
                  which seemed to occur two years after a ‘lower phase’ of the
                  North Atlantic and Pacific Decadal Oscilliations (NAO and PDO).
                  This changing of group size is another illustration of the adaptability of these predators.</p>

                  <p>The breeding assemblages of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus
                    gazella) at South Georgia provide an unusual opportunity to monitor
                    an apex marine predator species, especially as good quality data
                    exists from several decades (i.e. from summer 1984/5 onwards).
                    Forcada et al. (2005) studied this situation and their analysis indicated that positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies at
                    South Georgia, preceded by, and cross-correlated with, frequent
                    El Niño-La Niña events between 1987 and 1988, explained extreme
                    reductions in Antarctic fur seal pup production for the 20 years of
                    the study. The authors believe that these anomalies were likely to
                    be associated with low availability of prey, mainly krill.</p>
                    <p>Another relatively highly visible marine predator is the polar
                      bear (Ursus maritimus), which lives throughout the ice-covered
                      waters of the Arctic and particularly on near-shore annual ice
                      cover above the continental shelf where productivity is at its
                      highest (Derocher et al., 2004)5
                      . Climate change models predict
                      changes to the sea ice with reduced seal prey availability for
                      the bears. Derocher et al. (2004) have suggested that at first the
                      bears might be favoured by more annual ice with more leads in
                      it — making more suitable seal habitat available, but as the ice
                      thins further they will have to travel more — using up energy to
                      keep in contact with favoured habitat. Derocher et al. (2004) emphasise the ‘behavioural plasticity’ of all ursids but also note that
                      “given the rapid pace of ecological change in the Arctic, the long
                      generation time, and the highly specialised nature of polar bears,</p>
                      <p>it is unlikely that polar bears will survive as a species if the ice
                        disappears completely as has been predicted by some”. WWF
                        (2002) describe the polar bear as an ideal species through which
                        to monitor human-caused impacts in the ecosystem including
                        Climate Change. They note that in the Hudson and James Bays
                        of Canada, sea ice is now melting early in the spring and forming
                        later in the autumn and, therefore, the time that the bears have
                        on the ice, storing up energy for the summer and autumn when
                        there is little available food, is becoming shorter. In Hudson Bay,
                        the main cause of death for cubs is either an absence of food or
                        lack of fat on nursing mothers. </p>
                        <p>It should be stressed that Climate Change can — and probably

                    situation in 1996 was unusual or a sign of the future likely swings
                    in climate. The worst scenario would be a prolonged period of
                    negative NAO conditions. If right whale calving rates were depressed for a significant period of time, then the time to extinction would even become shorter than the 200 years pre­viously
                    predicted. Climate change and variability need, therefore, to
                    now be taken into account in the management of the recovery of
                    this population (Greene and Pershing, 2004). </p>
                    <h1 class="text-danger">Conclusions</h1>
                    <p>Perhaps the most obvious conclusion is that monitoring marine
                      systems and linking observed changes to effects is far from
                      easy. However, despite this, concerns for marine species are
                      increasingly underpinned by observed effects. The ways in
                      which Climate Change may affect marine predators are summarised in figure 1. This review also highlights the likely negative
                      consequences and particular vulnerability of species that are
                      dependent on the extent of sea ice. Similarly highlighted is the
                      vulnerability of small and isolated populations, such as that of
                      the northern right whale, where Climate Change is set to become
                      a determining factor in its survival</p>
                      <p>More generally, for all species, the key question concerns how
                        quickly they can adapt to changes in their habitats and prey.
                        It can be expected that at least some of the wider ranging predators – such as oceanic dolphins – are likely to be able to adapt
                        to some extent to movements in their resource base. Indeed,
                        even Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) (which are spectacularly long-lived and slow breeding ice-edge specialists) have
                        been able to change their patterns of habitat use several times
                        in the last 11,000, or so, years, apparently in response to changes
                        in ice conditions, currents or marine productivity (Würsig et al.,
                        2002). However, the current rates of change may be too great for
                        many species to keep up with them. </p>
                        <p>Monitoring for changes in marine species and systems, including identifying vulnerabilities will be difficult and expensive but
is also important and necessary for our understanding of global
processes, including within ecosystems where we directly ex-ploit resources.</p>
<p>The international fora that deal with species
  conservation have a major role in providing co-ordination and
  direction. The IWC, for example, has recognised over the last
  ten years the need to address environmental change issues, including the possible impacts of Climate Change.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic text-danger">
                  Consider the Australasian region at the end of the last Ice
                  Age when Australia and New Guinea formed one large land
                  mass. With a warming earth accompanied by melting ice
                  caps and glaciers, the sea level rose and the Indian Ocean
                  flooded into the Gulf of Carpentaria about 8,000 years BP, the
                  Pacific Ocean breached the Torres Strait land bridge about
                  7,000 years BP and the coral islands of the Great Barrier
                  Reef formed about 5,000 years BP. Turtle nesting beaches
                  of 10,000 years BP are now totally submerged and most of
                  the present day major marine turtle rookeries are located at
                  sites that were inaccessible across dry land less than 150
                  turtle generations ago. The present major migratory route
                  for adult green turtles feeding in eastern Indonesia, Arnhem
                  Land and the Gulf of Carpentaria through Torres Strait to the
                  Great Barrier Reef nesting beaches is a geologically recent
                  phenomenon</p>
                  <p class="fst-italic text-danger">Marine turtles have been among the great survivors of dramatic Climate Changes and fluctuating sea levels spanning tens
                    of millions of years since the age of the dinosaurs. Modern
                    marine turtle populations developed new migratory routes
                    and redistributed their breeding sites in response to changing climate and elevated sea levels since the last ice ages.
                    In general terms, responding to Climate Change should not
                    be a threat to marine turtle survival. Our concerns regard­ing
                    their response to present day Climate Change should centre
                    on their capacity to respond satisfactorily to an elevated rate
                    of Climate Change while simultaneously being impacted by
                    a wide range of significant threatening processes from human origins.</p>
              
                <h1 class="text-danger">Increasing Temperatures on Nesting Beaches</h1>
                <p>Marine turtles of both families, Dermochelyidae and Cheloniidae, lay eggs that require nest temperatures in the 25-32o
                  C for
                  successful incubation. Both families are characterised by temperature dependent sex determination. Cool beaches produce predominantly male hatchlings; warm beaches produce mostly
                  female hatchlings.</p>
               
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2 ">
                <img src="assets/images/impact5.JPG" alt="" width="100%" height="400px">
                <p>With increasing temperatures there is likely to be a feminising
                  of marine turtle populations. Over the last 50 years or so, some
                  critical nesting beaches like those in eastern mainland penin­sula
                  Malaysia have already shifted into a totally female produc­ing
                  temperature range presumably as a result of man-made changes
                  to the nesting habitat and the more subtle global increases in
                  temperature. While turtle populations appear to function successfully with an excess of females (male:female = 1:2 to 1:3),
                  there probably should be concerns if the regional sex ratio for
                  the species (stock) approaches 1:4 male to female.</p>
                  <p>Even without the current trend to warmer summers, sand temperatures at nest depth during mid summer in the tropics at some
                    beaches approach or exceed the upper lethal limit for egg incubation (340
                    C). At such tropical beaches in northern Australia,
                    marine turtles nest in winter while the same species (but different genetic stocks) in eastern and western Australia nests in the
                    mid summer but on cooler beaches. </p>
                    <p>In contrast, within the southern Great Barrier Reef, in the first
                      decades after our marine turtle studies commenced in 1968, we
                      never recorded sand temperatures at nest depth reaching the
                      34o
                      C lethal temperature at any nesting beach. Since the extraordinarily hot summer of December 1997 – January 1998, sand
                      temperatures at nest depth at Mon Repos are now reaching as
                      high as 36o
                      C for weeks at a time during hatching season.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-1 mt-3 mt-lg-0">
                <p>  In response to these excessively high nest temperatures, there has
                  been increased debilitation and even death of eggs and hatchlings. It can be predicted that with further increases in summer
                  temperatures, significant decreases in hatching success and
                  hatchling emergence from nests can be expected on beaches
                  that until recently were good turtle egg incubators.</p>
                  <p>A commonly held hypothesis is that marine turtles return to breed
                    at the beach at which they were born – such a behaviour implies
                    a static breeding association with specific locations. How­ever,
                    the loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, tagged as hatchlings
                    at Mon Repos beach decades ago are now returning to breed
                    at about 30 years of age but not just at Mon Repos. They are
                    returning to breed at many beaches in the region. When these
                    results are linked to the observations of past changes in nesting
                    distribution in response to the end of the ice ages, we need to
                    consider an alternate hypothesis regarding fidelity to ancestral
                    breeding sites: Marine turtle populations may return to the same
                    breeding area while environmental conditions remain stable but
                    they may shift to new breeding sites in response to changing
                    environmental cues such as sea temperature, beach stability
                    and proximity to suitable ocean current for dispersing hatchlings
                    to pelagic foraging areas. There is a range of temperature variables that will exert selective pressure on marine turtle nesting
                    biology: white sand beaches are cooler than dark sand beaches;
                    temperate beaches are cooler than tropical beaches; beaches
                    are cooler in winter than in summer.</p>
                    <p>I present the hypothesis that marine turtles will respond to Climate Change as they have done in the past through changes in
                      the distribution of nesting and changes in the associated migratory routes or through shifts their nesting to cooler months. I suggest that these changes will not occur primarily through changes
                      in behaviour of the existing adult population but rather through
                      changes occurring as new adults recruit to join the breeding population over future generations. Because of the long generation

                      <p>At nesting beaches with elevated sand dunes, turtles are expected to be little affected by sea level rise. Their nesting should
                        occur above the new tide levels. The situation will be very different with low elevation sand islands such as occurs widely in
                        the Pacific Island nations, the Caribbean, the Maldives and the
                        Great Barrier Reef. At these low elevation sand beaches, the
                        combined impact of erosion and flooding of the nesting habitat
                        is expected to cause increases in egg mortality and eventually
                        loss of some nesting beaches. It is uncertain whether reef building processes will keep pace with sea level rise to renourish the
                        beaches naturally. Turtles that lose their nesting beaches, are
                        expected to seek out new nesting sites. How turtles from very
                        remote/isolated sites will cope will loss of nesting habitat is con-jecture. </p>
